# Assignment-14
This assignment was given to me by my teachers at the University. The problem sounds like this:
Alexander, which is a toddler, has received as a birthday gift a Lego game. How-
ever, he was not able to construct the toy Lego, as there are many pieces. Alexan-
der has observed that each piece is numbered with a number starting from 1 to

1000. The instructions of the game state the pieces that need to be assembled
before each an every piece. Help Alexander to build his Lego toy by developing
an application which determines the correct order in which the piece of Lego
need to be assembled. he application should implement two different algorithms
to help Alexander.

Though I wasn't able to develop a program that will perfectly get to the solution. I was able to develop a part of the solution 
I used tropological sort, depth first search and a function that I created for assigning the orientation of the graph.
